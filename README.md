Hi, I’m Aryan—a 16-year-old [high school](https://kvsangathan.nic.in/en/) student from [Delhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi) who loves building things. I’m a pretty active [open-source contributor](https://github.com/aryan6673?tab=repositories), but most of my work comes through the projects I run myself on [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub). One of my projects recently started getting quite a lot of attention, which has been super motivating for me.  

I’m also the founder of the [DeyWeaver Foundation](https://npo.deyweaver.live), a legally registered [501(c)(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)(3)_organization) [nonprofit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization) based in [Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles), now fiscally sponsored by [IFERS](https://ifers.org/). Apart from coding and research, I’ve written my [first book](https://www.amazon.com/Zero-Job-job-without-waiting-college-ebook/dp/B0D57HYFZ5), and I sometimes dive into professional singing (with around 2.5M streams).  

I also volunteer a lot—I’m currently a Program Manager at [Youth Ideas at Work (YIAW)](https://yiaw.org/) and work on fun projects with [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/). At heart, I’m just a boy from [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India) with millions of dreams, always exploring what’s possible with [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science), [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology), and [innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation).  Oh, and if you’re curious, I’ve also made a small repo about the [journey of my life](https://github.com/aryan6673/LIFE).
